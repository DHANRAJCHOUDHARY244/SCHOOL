                            <p>Vysya Limelight Awards (VLA) is the brainchild of Siva Kumar Emmadi aka Emmadi, a Digital entrepreneur. Emmadi is also the Founder of Vysya Business Network (VBN) besides being an active member of the Vysya community. The genesis of the idea lies in the thought that all other communities were fusing their energies for the development of their own communities whereas the Vysya community was doing its own bit, albeit in a limited way. Emmadi felt that the Vysya community also needed to come together more effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>While more than 150-200 Vysya organisations exist and each one of them is working hard towards their own set objectives and goals there was not a single Association or Club that was formally celebrating the achievements of Vysyas in the country nor were they formally recognising their professional successes. Most of these entities were focusing on social and cultural spaces and very few were focussing on emerging technologies and businesses and how Vysyas can leverage them. Emmadi felt that changing dynamics need a changing thought process and he conceptualised Vysya Limelight Inc VLI a corporate entity to be the vehicle to meet this goal.Vysya Limelight Awards for Men - 2023 (VLA4M-2023)Vysya Limelight Awards for Men - 2023 (VLA4M-2023)</p>

<p>Potti Sreeramulu another Vysya served nation and his state of Andhra Pradesh until his last breath and achieved separate statehood for Andhra Pradesh. He is revered as Amarajeevi ("Immortal Being"). He is known all over India for undertaking a hunger strike in support of the formation of an Indian state for the Telugu-speaking population of Madras Presidency and he lost his life in the process.</p>
<p>Though known as traders, now the next-gen Vysyas are dominating e-commerce and start-up space. Vysyas are dominating even the new economy. India's leading e-commerce companies such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Ola, Naaptol, Yebhi and Myntra have been founded by enterprising entrepreneurs belong to this community.</p>
<p>The Vysya community contributes to the nation's exchequer by paying huge taxes. Vysyas are always ahead in charity, whether it's running an education institution or rendering social service. The name Vysyas is synonymous to "Annadanam".</p>

<p>I Siva Kumar Emmadi, extremely delighted to welcome you all to our first ever Vysya Limelight Awards. Permit me to say here that the Awards were the outcome of my long study of the Vysya business and professional community and the search for the best ways and means to empower the members of the community. During this long process I discovered a niche that the community was not formally celebrating the achievements and success stories of its members and there existed a need for honouring such people</p>
